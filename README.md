# Othello

Othello is my first main project and game ever. It is one of my academic projects.<br>
Othello is a boardgame that I tried to develop with C++.<br>
I also imported the .exe file, in case you couldn't or didn't want to compile the code.<br>
You can read about the rules of the game online; the rest is easy. You can play by choosing the rows and columns of the cell you want to select.<br>
This project was written in 2017.
